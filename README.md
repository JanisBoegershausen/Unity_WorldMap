# World-Map
An easy to use system to create all kinds of world maps for your unity game. 

## Warning
This is currently in a very early stage of development and I am not working on this very actively. 
At the moment this contains:
- A map window with navigation and zoom
- A location system using scriptable objects
- Location popups for hovered location
- Simple travel system by teleporting to a given location

Detailed readme coming soon.
